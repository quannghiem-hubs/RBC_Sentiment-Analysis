"I went to this bank branch today because I forgot to set up my pin on my RBC Mastercard and needed it for my trip. The employee who originally helped me was very nice but when the manager Darlene intervened, she was pretty much the rudest person I’ve come across in customer service. She wouldn’t even let me speak and basically treated me like a criminal because I didn’t activate my pin in my home province. I was truly shocked with her behaviour towards me. Definitely one of the worst customer service experiences I’ve personally experienced. Very disappointing.",2.2,1732157653
I wanted 2 rolls of quarters. There was no line up. Had my debit card ready. 30 minutes later I’m still answering security questions and have to speak consent to decline the up-sold ‘service’ the teller was offering. The interaction started with having to confirm the date I started the account. Decades ago! I’m lucky I remembered (guessed) the month correctly. I was there for quarters for laundry. Other branches get this done for me in under 10 minutes. Do the downtown employees do this stuff for sport?,2.2,1731438158
"Absolute worst automated customer service phone line I've ever encountered. Was near impossible to connect with an agent, and the operator wasted many valuable minutes of international call time providing obvious information without letting me proceed then hanging up on after unnecessarily explaining what online banking is. When I finally connected with an agent, the line was muffled and she could not hear me despite there being no issues with my phone. She then hung up on me.",2.2,1735543515
Most of the advisors are unprofessional and behave rudely. I don't know why the bank management ignores the numerous complaints from customers unless they are trying to hide something or cannot force the employees to work seriously for reasons that may appear later...,2.2,1728780680
"Tried to give RBC my business and they botched it in the 2/2 possible ways a bank could botch it.

1/2 money in: I opened an account then immediately set it up for my payroll. A fews days go by and my pay run bounced because RBC had frozen my account. I didn't get paid until the next pay run. Worst of all was the 3 hours attempting to get to a manager via customer service number, yielding nothing, their agents are neutered, they said wait a few days and that the manager would just say the same thing and refused to transfer me.

2/2 money out: I tried to send an e transfer. This was denied by their system. A few hours on hold eventually told me it was a security feature but it wasn't fixed. The app was forcing me to tap my bank card on my phone to initiate a transfer but did not recognize it despite using NFC for payments all the time. Customer service this time told me my card was bad. Went into a branch and my card was fine apparently. Withdrew all funds and closed the account while in branch.

Hopefully this saves you the time and stress I experienced. Literally any bank is better than RBC.",2.2,1718167333
"This branch has been kind to me from the very beginning. I wanted to personally thank Mr. Neil Patel for managing my case with the utmost care and efficiency. His attention to detail and expertise allowed me to feel safe whilst renewing my mortgage (and more).

Looking forward to my next interaction with Mr. Patel!",2.4,1733257724
I was there very early in the morning and yet the staff was so welcoming! Jack at the desk was very helpful and friendly. He patiently heard my query and promptly solved it. Greatly appreciated! My work was done in no time.,2.4,1736776882
"I have decided to change my bank, but I wanted to share my recent experience.

I have found Scotiabank to be the most untrustworthy bank in Canada. In the last 30 days, they have been under maintenance for 10 days, which amounts to over 33% of their service time. Furthermore, I made a bill payment seven days ago, and it still does not appear in my billing account, resulting in a penalty for late payment.
Additionally, I experienced a frustrating wait of 1 hour and 45 minutes for customer support, only to be told that I need to call back tomorrow as my issue cannot be resolved today.

I sincerely hope that scotiabank goes bankrupt soon so no other customer has to endure such poor service in the future.

Edit 2: Called again today on November  24th,since I cannot transfer my money from savings to chequing and took 45 mins to connect with a representative.He did some security questions and asked what is the issue,explained to him and he said please stay on hold and then cut the damn line.Do better Scotia",2.4,1732484627
This company has continued to harass me after getting a mortgage. Do not trust them with your information as they will abuse this privilege and try to push every product they have on you with zero regard for their customers. Do Better.,2.4,1736471755
"This review is addressed to Scotiabank company for customer feedback. RBC IS BEST FOR FIRST CREDIT CARD.

Im leaving this 1 star for several several reasons. They never allowed me to have my first credit card although they were the first I applied for. Furthermore, even when I got my first credit card from another bank and good  good credit score standing, they still refuse me for credit card. After many years of good credit score,  when I purchased a car, scotiabank was the first random pick in the system to be asked, they denied me for car loan. Consequently, in total I had like 3-4 Scotiabank credit inquiry history in my credit report with ZERO HELP from Scotiabank ( ones for credit card + car loan).

The other bank that was always helpful and first to help is RBC! Rbc has been very good to me even when I had nothing, like zero credit history to start with. From credit cards to loans, they were and will be the first to say YES. That’s why they are top bank in Canada cos they are willing to be help people unlike Scotiabank!!

This bank company doesn’t deserve any 5 stars from me for their treatment. I don’t like this bank for the above reasons! They don’t give opportunities.",2.4,1734332151
"Horrible customer services surprisingly from the teller manager initial JC,
Please hire more quality people that know how to give good customer service and more importantly train your employees well before you promote them.
If I have an option to put 0 star, I will gladly to rate this branch for it.",2.1,1686337206
I dont normally write reviews but the customer service from the branch manager Derek Richardson was truly above and beyond. I came in a bit before closing and he stayed late calling the main office multiple times and having many frustrating conversions to make sure my issue was solved. I was really going to leave HSBC but thanks to him I have decided to keep my account,2.1,1685551178
"Service was good. They only have two desks for tellers so service can be slow. To be fair I don't expect much from actually needing to walk into a bank, I've never had ""fast"" service at a bank. But they handled my weird request quick enough and helped me out with some issues on my account I was unaware of.",2.1,1562771129
"You can't manage a bank and have one employee only taking care of customers on Monday morning. Management-wise, it makes no sense and it's incompetent scheduling. It's Monday. Waiting 30 minutes in line for a service that usually takes 3 minutes.",2.1,1694447720
"Great branch. I had a terrible experience at the Bay and Bloor branch with rude service and this branch couldn’t have been better.

The teller Tennyson was super helpful, friendly, thorough and they were able to get me the USD I was looking to withdraw.

I would definitely recommend anyone to use this branch.",2.1,1652794443
"Daniel at the bank provided exceptional service during my recent visit.
From the moment I walked in, he was incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. Daniel went above and beyond to ensure all my questions were answered and that I felt confident in my decisions.
His professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction truly stood out. I highly recommend Daniel for anyone seeking top-notch service at the bank!",2.9,1724363824
"I went here today to do some work. The employee that helped me was really kind and nice, and it took me only 15ish mins to finish the thing. I was worried since I saw how the low rate the reviews were, but there really was nothing to worry about!",2.9,1717773467
I just did a transaction to TD Yonge and Adelaide location with Daniel Torchia as my customer service rep. He was so patient and very helpful. He have pleasing personality and a good customer service. He was very specific and detailed regarding the transaction. I am happy and satisfied. Congratulations TD you hired a good and reliable person. Thank you so much Daniel. See you next time.,2.9,1685558967
"TL;DR: The teller wearing light dress shirt who looked like South Asian that I spoke with was not knowledged nor informative. Provided me with the wrong info when I think he could have simply checked my id and reset my credit card info. Instead I waited hours on the VISA line only to be told I cannot. C'mon man.

Longer Story:
My credit happened to be blocked when I tried to make a purchase at Sleep Country right across the street from this branch. So I approached the gentleman at about 5:52pm. Sure it was closing in about 8 minutes but that does not mean you deceive the customer and send them home with the wrong information. A customer service on TD told me that I needed to reset my credit card either at an ATM or a branch, but this teller told me credit card can only be done through VISA and told me to go back and call the number on the line. I gave up after waiting for the first two calls for 40 and 10 minutes respectively (Both my earphone and phone battery were dropping very low).
I then headed home and finally got a call after nearly 2 hours on the line, but only to be told that it is against the federal law to change credit card pins or resets over the phone, and that this must be done at a local branch in-person. Honestly that gentleman at the bank indirectly wasted 3 hours of my time by providing me with incorrect information.

Now, I understand that you may want to go home after a long day, but the job is not done at 5:52pm, it finishes at 6pm when the branch closes or when you are off work. If he had that mindset, I find it highly unacceptable, if not, he needs more training or learning. I certianly hope that this South Asian gentleman will be properly trained and educated by the branch staff not just for me but for other future customers who might be dealing with him.",2.9,1655784873
"Horrible service I ever had in TD bank. This branch have a very poor costumer service. I came today with a request deposit my change to my account. I understand that I had a lot of change, but I spent 20 mins on nothing. They guy, who works there, asked me to count by myself everything. I did it. Then, he asked me how many I have the same coins and he said he will help me. He disappeared and sent a lady who asked me to do even more work. I am not a student there and not working there, why am I suppose to do all this work? These people are getting money for their job that they can not do normally. I asked that lady why I have to do it? She said you have to do it, it’s not our job. Then I said that I will go to another bank. She said bye to me. Horrible costumer service, honestly.",2.9,1650478775

"Found a Simplii Debit Mastercard on public transit and went into this CIBC branch to turn it in. (Simplii Financial™ is a trademark and division of CIBC. Banking products and services branded Simplii Financial™ are offered by CIBC.)

Me: Do you take the Simplii card here?
Teller: No, it’s only at the ATM.
Me: Okay. Just to let you know, I just found this lost Simplii card. (And I leave and throw it into their trash bin on the way out.)",3.7,1718683532

"The whole place reeks. Hair oil. Food. A vile stench that is gag inducing. Reassuringly lackadaisical when it comes to helping a customer. The air conditioning has been turned all the way up to sauna levels.

"I recently had the pleasure of banking with this branch, and I must say, the experience exceeded my expectations. From the moment I walked in, the staff exhibited unparalleled professionalism and patience.

I made a mistake during my transaction, but instead of showing frustration or impatience, the staff went above and beyond to assist me. Their calm demeanor and willingness to guide me through the process made all the difference. It's rare to find such dedicated individuals who genuinely care about their customers.

The entire process was incredibly smooth, thanks to the expertise of the staff. They took the time to address all my concerns and ensure that I understood each step of the way. Their attention to detail and commitment to customer satisfaction are truly commendable.

I highly recommend this branch to anyone seeking exceptional banking services. The staff here set the standard for excellence, and I am grateful for their assistance. Thank you for a wonderful experience!",4.4,1713973950

"Carlos’ service is not acceptable & very rude. Doesn’t have enough knowledge to serve customers. I’m with TD more than 20 years & this morning, I was not expecting this behaviour from the branch. I’m seeking attention from management.",2.9,1732644479
"I cannot believe the unprofessionalism displayed by the management at this branch. My 82 year old mother has been banking here for many years. Her situation is not complex but she does have an American and Canadian account. The bank made a mistake and when she went to remedy the situation, they made her wait in the lobby over an hour even though she had an appointment. This caused a huge inconvenience and when they refused to correct their mistake, the manager called my mother “senile”. I am sparing a lot of the details but I have NEVER heard of a business treating their customers this way!",2.9,1713367262
"Prepare yourself to confirm that 3 out of 5 rating. Tldr, I was told that I could not change the address with TD without proof of my attachment to the address. Having a mortgage for that exact property with TD is not proof enough. It took some persuasion to uncover that common sense under the layers of TD processes. Anyway, if you want to come and work on your patience and people skills, it is the best place :)",2.9,1697723127
John Costa was an excellent representative. I went there to open a new account. I forgot my documents but he patiently allowed me to go home and get them on a Friday evening.He went above and beyond to inform me of all the best offers and was very honest. Definitely recommend,2.9,1700260548

"I was supposed to meet with a Linda Bin for an appointment regarding a credit card, I did not receive any email from Scalia bank regarding the time and location for this meeting. Upon finally getting through to their customer service they were able to give me the branch and address. This caused a delay in me getting there and Linda who was supposed to meet me upon arrival explained how she’s busy and can’t meet me. Then she said we can’t ‘magically extend’ the terms on your card which was so unprofessional and insulting cuz she was addressing me in front of a crowd of people that dint have to hear about my banking needs or any personal info regarding what I was there for. She further discussed the exact amount that I was approved for and my employment status in front of a crowd of people that absolutely had no reason to hear such personal details about me. I don’t remember the last time I embarrassed this terribly and I am considering taking legal action if possible for the disrespect I’ve had to face today due to unprofessional behaviour of people this bank appoints to represent them.
Wouldn’t reckoned them or their services as this branch is run by a group of unprofessional and disrespectful people.",2.3,1728326808
"Complete incompetence:

1. Needed to wire money, teller doesn’t know how. Waited 30min in line + 20min for on-the-spot teller training (Church & Carlton)

2. Needed a direct deposit form that showed the business name. Teller doesn’t know how. Had to come in again because the first form listed our business account as an employee

3. Mysteriously charged $40. Support on the phone said to go to the teller because they can't see any further info. The teller threw guesses: it was your account fee (no it was $6 each month), it was a rebate (no it was a minus sign), oh it's for going after the transaction limit (no we only had 7 transactions in the last 30 days). We still don't know why we got charged so we have to schedule with our account advisor AFTER the statement comes out, for this UNKNOWN amount charged by the branch.

Switch to other banks. The hours saved will makes up for the cheaper banking fees. If you stay, be ready to defend your account from the incompetent shenanigans and educated guesses that these tellers have in store.",2.3,1734474818
"I opened an account 10 months ago for their new account $350 bonus. Met all the criteria for the bonus and they refused to debit my account.

Thats pretty much fraud.",2.3,1731644425
"Went to this bank today to replace my bank card. This chinese lady bank teller was asking for information that i had previously disclosed to Scotiabank customer service. the notes were already linked on my account. After this she started handing random papers asking for my bank details for “verification” mind you i have NEVER in my life jumped through so much loops to get a new debit card. Usually ID is enough. so as the cautious person i am i am asking for more information as to why she is asking the same questions over and over. anyways i speak to another telling end up filling out the requested form and he send me to SCARBOROUGH to unlock my account because i answered the questions “wrong” how would i not know what my mothers maiden name is? Plus, i was previously leveled out of my online banking account so for them to ask me what my estimated balance is and i not know.. like why are we surprised, of course i cant tell you i haven’t looked at my account in 4 flipping days. anyways due to this racist interaction i have closed my scotiabank account. there are too many banks in canada to work with someone who you don’t like.",2.3,1718650067
Complete incompetence. Was told I couldn’t set auto deposit to pay off my credit card by the front desk tellers only then to get a financial advisor who said it was possible but he couldn’t do it on his system because he doesn’t have access and I’d have to go to my home branch!,2.3,1718312291

Have a secured home equity line of credit and reported to Equifax and trans union as unsecured and affecting my credit. I have called 4 times and advised to let the credit bureau know this. Home trust would not provide a letter to this effect and the bureaus will not change unless I have a letter. I asked for a supervisor Jan 17 and was told 2 to 3 business days. It’s a week and nothing. Called today again no supervisor??? Was told nothing they could do to help me. I can’t even get a call back to discuss or a solution? I need a letter to confirm it is secured but you will not provide!HELP!!!,2.5,1737642239
"Called to request a credit increase. Was told that they would need to do a credit check in order to do that. They asked for my permission and was told that it would take seven to ten days. I could get a mortgage in that time , however I consented. After two weeks I hadn’t heard anything I called to find out the progress. I was told that I couldn’t request an increase before six months. At the time of my initial phone call it was a little over two weeks until the six months was up, but they accepted my request and asked if they  could do a credit check which I consented to. No one mentioned that I could not increase the the amount before six months. I asked to speak to a manager and was told they were not available. It is quite obvious that they are hiring minimum wage employees with poor English skills and not training them adequately. The customer service is poor at best.

Received a reply very quickly regarding my review. Acknowledged that the situation was not handled appropriately, and provided a new phone number to call so that a resolution could be expedited. Phoned the next morning and surprise! I get the general customer service centre and some poor representative who knows nothing about my issue, and doesn’t know who does. After being on hold for several minutes was told someone would call me by days end.
After receiving a reply to my review I would have expected that a manager would contact me, not send me a phone number to call where I get the run around again. As I said before, customer service is terrible. The representative that I spoke to did all that he could, but there is obviously a large problem with management.
So the saga continues. After yesterday’s phone call, I was assured I would receive a phone call by days end. That did not happen. It is very apparent that this company has no real interest in resolving any problems. They send a response to a review and hope that you do not actually act on the offer to contact them. When you do respond, they leave it to the customer service rep to deal with the unhappy customers. Quite a unique management style. If you deal with this company, do not expect any actual customer service if you have an issue.",2.5,1734528730
"They deliberately made us do two Appraisals on our house. They took 50% each time, one of the individuals doing the appraisal showed us the email from home trust proving this. They tack on an insane amount of fees that add up very quickly when trying to get a loan or a mortgage. We figured it would be easy as we already had our mortgage with them We asked for a home equity loan and they insisted a visa card was better but it really is worse. Higher interest and the rate will never go down. I do not recommend this company.",2.5,1730206258
"If you are looking for someone to invest with, I am sure they are great, as a B lender for mortgages, they are horrid.
As a freelancer, during the pandemic, our options were very limited, and Home Trust took full advantage.
Most lenders make their money either with high renewal fees, or high interest rates.  Home Trust does both.
They have antiquated practices that involved having to walk a cheque into their office whenever they can, and be late on a payment and they punish you in a biblical fashion.
Honestly steer clear of these guys if you need a loan at all cost.
Anyone that suggests them as a lender is NOT your friend.

"I have been a customer of Home Trust Preferred Visa for more than 5 years.  My experience had been very positive when dealing with their agents and when I called them up before my overseas trips so that purchases abroad will go through smoothly during the stated timeframe.   I primarily used this card for purchasing items overseas since they have the no foreign exchange fees features (saving hundreds on expensive items) as opposed to being charged 3 % from other credit card companies.   If you travel often, this is a great card to have in your wallet.",2.5,1725727820
"As both a long-time customer of this branch, over 10 years, I want to provide some balanced feedback on the service at this branch. I understand many people's frustration about slow service and staff interactions, but there's more to the story behind the scenes.

One major issue is the reduction of hours for employees. Most staff members are part-time, working only 20 hours a week, even though many are available and willing to work full-time or take on more shifts. This decision, driven by management, has led to understaffing, overworked employees, and higher turnover rates. The frequent rotations of staff mean many are new or still adjusting, making it hard for the team to provide the level of service customers expect. - that's feedback from the staff

Additionally, the pressure on employees to prioritize sales over solving customers' issues is a problem. The staff are genuinely kind and hardworking, but they're often left without the support they need. Managers are frequently unavailable for necessary overrides, causing delays, and employees are left to handle the fallout, which can understandably frustrate both sides.

While the service quality has definitely declined, I believe it's due to poor management choices rather than the fault of the individuals working at the branch. They are doing their best with the limited resources and support they have. As a customer, I also hate the long waits and issues like check holds, but I feel it's important to recognize the broader challenges the staff are facing.

I hope all these kids find something better than what this place is.",2.1,1730324742
"This branch has the longest, most miserable and unbearable wait times. Just to do a simple business deposit will take you an average of 45 minutes and I’ve been here several times and things are likely not to improve. Why can’t they add more staff to assist customers? You really have to give it to TD that it is in their expertise to leave customers with unpleasant experience. That’s all they’re good at. Instead of making customers happy, they’ll make you frustrated. I’m sure they’ll respond to this review saying to email their customer service which eventually, nothing will be done.",2.1,1731702407
"Not only did this department misplace a draft for $270,000, they waited nearly a week to report so and in the process lied and stated that it was the fault of a fellow professional at one of the branches. Not only was I present to see that the planner included the draft along with all of the other necessary documentation, but it was sent registered and is documented that it was received on a Tuesday and after several days of following up and inquiring what the status is this department finally admitted on Friday that they did not have the draft. And at that time tried to place blame on my financial planner here in Niagara. This sort of conduct was not only unprofessional, but I was shocked at the complete and utter lack of accountability. Fast-forward a week later, they have received a letter of indemnity so that the other financial institution can process a new draft And they have yet to sign and process that one single document. So now I have $270,000 floating around doing absolutely nothing for weeks on end and this facility this department with these people not only have shown no accountability, but have displayed gross negligence, a complete disregard for myself and my family as a client at this bank, zero sense of urgency to resolve the matter that they themselves have created. I have never observed and witness such a pathetic and ignorant chain of events at a financial institution that is supposed to be of such status . A disgrace.",2.1,1726505578

"I was expecting to receive some funds as reflecting my equity in my home.  Part way through the process I realized that I had only 50% equity.

"CIBC is out of touch with modern investing. The buy and hold model by and large doesn’t make sense anymore. Making a 6% yield on a stock that loses 15% is bad business. This has caused my investments to suffer losing years and also to miss out on what would have been successful trends. CIBC needs to realize that to set it and forget it is antiquated in the era of people being able to trade and therefore affect trends from their sofa.   Sometimes short term liquidation is better than to chase losses, then reinvest. It appears that they do not look for opportunities. There’s a reason why CIBC is not rated well by retirees.",2,1671820342

"I came to this Branch as I've had a previous Account with BMO but my Account was Closed due to inactivity and me not contacting my previous Bank.

So I've come to this Branch on Bay St, twice so far as they've asked me for Additional ID this time to re-open the Account, in addition I gave them my Previous BMO bank Card that they deactivated.

So I went to Service Ontario and I applied to get a Provincial ID and that takes 4-6 weeks of delivery.

So I brought Service Canada's Receipt with me Containing the original Copy that this bank has Kept, and now informs me that they'll call me in 3 or 4 business days, mind you I have the Same Birth certificates today as I used before, and I have the Same Ontario Health Card that I provide the Same as Then when I opened my Original Account on Eglinton Ave.

Mind while I Used these Same ID's today that The BMO in Brantford Accepted from me in September 2023.

So my question now is why aren't these Vary Same ID's accepted at this Branch.

And why has this Process become so difficult that it takes 3 visits in person to the Bank..Then to be... told to wait for their Response that would take 3-5 business working days for them to reply to me by Phone.

While in addition..I've also offered additional ID's and a Letter from the (Department of Corrections from To The Correctional Services of Canada, Federal Parolee for 18 years, whose gonna come into a Bank in the first place admitting to be an Ex-con in the first Place.

Personally....and truly...no matter how badly I truly need this Bank Account...that after this and ""once I do recieve my Provincial ID from Service Canada within their 4-6 Week waiting Period.

There's absolutely""No Way that I Will Stay with BMO after this experience especially where this Serverally has Effect my Grant and My Loan that has been Offered to me as a $26.000 loan, which OSAP Student Funding awaits my Banking Details in order to Complete this Enrollment.

Which means that This could Possibly be Setting my College Courses by Another Year when it's Scheduled to completion for June 20th 2025.

My recent experience of opening a new account was nothing short of frustrating, and I strongly believe that the service provided was subpar.

I pointed out that the posted hours indicate you're open until 6 pm, but he rudely responded, ""I said it's appointment only."" Since when do you have to make an appointment to ask a teller a question? This all happened while they were chatting with each other, and there were no other customers in the branch besides me.

Even when I told them that I was switching all my accounts to TD they were Not professional at all. Over two month waiting, and if I didn't contact them, they would never contacted me. One advisor throw me to another. They tried 4 times for the application and at the end they told me that I would NEVER get approved for any type of credit card, not even for the minimum amount and recommended me to apply after six months. However, when applied by myself, just an hour after they said I would never get approved,  from the app, I've got approved. It's either I do really know how to apply or they actually don't know what they are doing or how to help customers or most likely both!. When I contact the first advisor, they took soo long to reply back and they were rude because I asked for an update and they told me ""I am just a part timer"". I was literally considering close all my accounts with TD and go to another bank because of the way I was treated!

"I am incredibly disappointed with my experience with BMO and this branch. I was working with Jasintha Kaneshakumar opening up a new chequings and savings account for my fiancée together and was told to follow criteria to receive a new signing bonus of $350 and $250 for their winter promotion. We have filled both requirements and I have been calling not only the branch but bmo's telephone line as well and I am constantly being transferred and given the runaround and fed different information of ""oh you've met the criteria just wait for the deposit"" and ""we will contact you back with more information"" only to not receive a call back nor have any of my questions answered. All my emails have also led me to believe I was eligible and everything was fine (As I have attached my exchange with Jasintha)

Now that the promotional period has ended I'm now being told I never qualified to begin with because this account is considered ""joint"". If that were the case I was misled from the beginning during the account opening with Jasintha and was not informed that I would be ineligible if that is how the account was to be created. I have wasted 3 months trying to fill these requirements and had to lock away $10000 in the savings account only to be told I wasted my time.

Make sure you read the documentation before you make any decisions working with BMO because they clearly do everything in their power to misdirect you and waste your time. Take your hard earned money elsewhere.

Edit: As expected no response and accountability from this BMO branch. Reached out to the email provided in their response on Monday and have not heard back. The representative that said they'd call me back the next day has not responded either when I called June 18th. It is now July 3rd and still no response or update.

The teller accepted bills in the amount of 2000 Swiss francs. The process of converting this amount into US dollars took approximately 30 minutes, during which the teller repeatedly checked the bills and consulted with their supervisor to ensure everything was in order. The teller also changed the amount of US dollars we were to receive three times, which I believe was a violation of proper procedure and un professional. Eventually, we agreed to the final amount, received the US dollars in an envelope, and were given a receipt confirming the completion of the transaction.

Two weeks later, I received a phone call from the same teller at RBC bank informing me that the bank could not accept the bills and that I needed to return to the branch to collect the Swiss francs and return the US dollars. I was shocked and upset by this call. My brother has since left Canada with the money, and I cannot return it to the bank. The bank had verified and accepted the bills, and I believe it is unacceptable for the bank to attempt to cancel or reverse a completed transaction two weeks after it was verified and completed.
A week after the first call, I received another call, this time from the branch supervisor, who notified me that I must collect the bills, and meanwhile, he put a hold on equivalent amount of money on my personal RBC account.
RBC used my personal identification, which I had provided for the currency exchange, to subsequently locate my RBC account and block funds on it.
I consider this action is a violation of my personal rights my consumer rights and, in my opinion, the Act of Bank Conducting Banking Operations.
Iwill pursue legal action. In court, I will seek compensation for all damages incurred as a result of the bank holding my funds and harassing me via telephone.",2.5,1730480147

"Complete incompetence:

1. Needed to wire money, teller doesn’t know how. Waited 30min in line + 20min for on-the-spot teller training

2. Needed a direct deposit form that showed the business name. Teller doesn’t know how. Had to come in again because the first form listed our business account as an employee (Bay & Queen)

3. Mysteriously charged $40. Support on the phone said to go to the teller because they can't see any further info. The teller threw guesses: it was your account fee (no it was $6 each month), it was a rebate (no it was a minus sign), oh it's for going after the transaction limit (no we only had 7 transactions in the last 30 days). We still don't know why we got charged so we have to schedule with our account advisor AFTER the statement comes out, for this UNKNOWN amount charged by the branch. (Bay & Queen)

Switch to other banks. The hours saved will makes up for the cheaper banking fees. If you stay, be ready to defend your account from the incompetent shenanigans and educated guesses that these tellers have in store.",2.6,1734474856

"My experiences at this bank is quite distressing and painful - for the most part I found two tellers specially - I think one is a team lead or a supervisor. They make errors and serious ones and behave as if it’s our fault and are very dismissive and rude. A serious error was made with a payment of over 500+ and the supervisor was overseeing a trainee and the payment went somewhere else. Month after I found out and when I went it there was no apology, remorse or attempt to help rectify the situation. I had to end up double paying as I was charged interest. I went back and forth and had to call the places they made the mistake with and I had to pay. We are valuable clients and this does not resonate well. If it weren’t for clients the banks could not be in existence. I still have lost over 500+ no fault of my own - and this is hard in these times.",3,1720209194

Then there was a bank teller who I forgot to get his name - he was a tall South Asian looking man, who again failed to greet or bother asking why I was there (has TD changed their customer service training that I wasn't aware of?). He slammed the card machine right in front of me and that just further ruined the whole experience. The whole transaction was silent and no words were exchanged.

"I have decided to change my bank, but I wanted to share my recent experience.

I have found Scotiabank to be the most untrustworthy bank in Canada. In the last 30 days, they have been under maintenance for 10 days, which amounts to over 33% of their service time. Furthermore, I made a bill payment seven days ago, and it still does not appear in my billing account, resulting in a penalty for late payment.
Additionally, I experienced a frustrating wait of 1 hour and 45 minutes for customer support, only to be told that I need to call back tomorrow as my issue cannot be resolved today.

I sincerely hope that scotiabank goes bankrupt soon so no other customer has to endure such poor service in the future.

"This review is addressed to Scotiabank company for customer feedback. RBC IS BEST FOR FIRST CREDIT CARD.

Im leaving this 1 star for several several reasons. They never allowed me to have my first credit card although they were the first I applied for. Furthermore, even when I got my first credit card from another bank and good  good credit score standing, they still refuse me for credit card. After many years of good credit score,  when I purchased a car, scotiabank was the first random pick in the system to be asked, they denied me for car loan. Consequently, in total I had like 3-4 Scotiabank credit inquiry history in my credit report with ZERO HELP from Scotiabank ( ones for credit card + car loan).

The other bank that was always helpful and first to help is RBC! Rbc has been very good to me even when I had nothing, like zero credit history to start with. From credit cards to loans, they were and will be the first to say YES. That’s why they are top bank in Canada cos they are willing to be help people unlike Scotiabank!!

I highly recommend this branch to anyone seeking exceptional banking services. The staff here set the standard for excellence, and I am grateful for their assistance. Thank you for a wonderful experience!",4.4,1713973950

"TL;DR: The teller wearing light dress shirt who looked like South Asian that I spoke with was not knowledged nor informative. Provided me with the wrong info when I think he could have simply checked my id and reset my credit card info. Instead I waited hours on the VISA line only to be told I cannot. C'mon man.

Longer Story:
My credit happened to be blocked when I tried to make a purchase at Sleep Country right across the street from this branch. So I approached the gentleman at about 5:52pm. Sure it was closing in about 8 minutes but that does not mean you deceive the customer and send them home with the wrong information. A customer service on TD told me that I needed to reset my credit card either at an ATM or a branch, but this teller told me credit card can only be done through VISA and told me to go back and call the number on the line. I gave up after waiting for the first two calls for 40 and 10 minutes respectively (Both my earphone and phone battery were dropping very low).
I then headed home and finally got a call after nearly 2 hours on the line, but only to be told that it is against the federal law to change credit card pins or resets over the phone, and that this must be done at a local branch in-person. Honestly that gentleman at the bank indirectly wasted 3 hours of my time by providing me with incorrect information.

Now, I understand that you may want to go home after a long day, but the job is not done at 5:52pm, it finishes at 6pm when the branch closes or when you are off work. If he had that mindset, I find it highly unacceptable, if not, he needs more training or learning. I certianly hope that this South Asian gentleman will be properly trained and educated by the branch staff not just for me but for other future customers who might be dealing with him.",2.9,1655784873
"Horrible service I ever had in TD bank. This branch have a very poor costumer service. I came today with a request deposit my change to my account. I understand that I had a lot of change, but I spent 20 mins on nothing. They guy, who works there, asked me to count by myself everything. I did it. Then, he asked me how many I have the same coins and he said he will help me. He disappeared and sent a lady who asked me to do even more work. I am not a student there and not working there, why am I suppose to do all this work? These people are getting money for their job that they can not do normally. I asked that lady why I have to do it? She said you have to do it, it’s not our job. Then I said that I will go to another bank. She said bye to me. Horrible costumer service, honestly.",2.9,1650478775
"I went to this bank branch today because I forgot to set up my pin on my RBC Mastercard and needed it for my trip. The employee who originally helped me was very nice but when the manager Darlene intervened, she was pretty much the rudest person I’ve come across in customer service. She wouldn’t even let me speak and basically treated me like a criminal because I didn’t activate my pin in my home province. I was truly shocked with her behaviour towards me. Definitely one of the worst customer service experiences I’ve personally experienced. Very disappointing.",2.2,1732157653
I wanted 2 rolls of quarters. There was no line up. Had my debit card ready. 30 minutes later I’m still answering security questions and have to speak consent to decline the up-sold ‘service’ the teller was offering. The interaction started with having to confirm the date I started the account. Decades ago! I’m lucky I remembered (guessed) the month correctly. I was there for quarters for laundry. Other branches get this done for me in under 10 minutes. Do the downtown employees do this stuff for sport?,2.2,1731438158
"Absolute worst automated customer service phone line I've ever encountered. Was near impossible to connect with an agent, and the operator wasted many valuable minutes of international call time providing obvious information without letting me proceed then hanging up on after unnecessarily explaining what online banking is. When I finally connected with an agent, the line was muffled and she could not hear me despite there being no issues with my phone. She then hung up on me.",2.2,1735543515

"Tried to give RBC my business and they botched it in the 2/2 possible ways a bank could botch it.

1/2 money in: I opened an account then immediately set it up for my payroll. A fews days go by and my pay run bounced because RBC had frozen my account. I didn't get paid until the next pay run. Worst of all was the 3 hours attempting to get to a manager via customer service number, yielding nothing, their agents are neutered, they said wait a few days and that the manager would just say the same thing and refused to transfer me.

2/2 money out: I tried to send an e transfer. This was denied by their system. A few hours on hold eventually told me it was a security feature but it wasn't fixed. The app was forcing me to tap my bank card on my phone to initiate a transfer but did not recognize it despite using NFC for payments all the time. Customer service this time told me my card was bad. Went into a branch and my card was fine apparently. Withdrew all funds and closed the account while in branch.

Hopefully this saves you the time and stress I experienced. Literally any bank is better than RBC.",2.2,1718167333

This caused a delay in me getting there and Linda who was supposed to meet me upon arrival explained how she’s busy and can’t meet me. Then she said we can’t ‘magically extend’ the terms on your card which was so unprofessional and insulting cuz she was addressing me in front of a crowd of people that dint have to hear about my banking needs or any personal info regarding what I was there for. She further discussed the exact amount that I was approved for and my employment status in front of a crowd of people that absolutely had no reason to hear such personal details about me. I don’t remember the last time I embarrassed this terribly and I am considering taking legal action if possible for the disrespect I’ve had to face today due to unprofessional behaviour of people this bank appoints to represent them.

"Complete incompetence:

1. Needed to wire money, teller doesn’t know how. Waited 30min in line + 20min for on-the-spot teller training (Church & Carlton)

2. Needed a direct deposit form that showed the business name. Teller doesn’t know how. Had to come in again because the first form listed our business account as an employee

3. Mysteriously charged $40. Support on the phone said to go to the teller because they can't see any further info. The teller threw guesses: it was your account fee (no it was $6 each month), it was a rebate (no it was a minus sign), oh it's for going after the transaction limit (no we only had 7 transactions in the last 30 days). We still don't know why we got charged so we have to schedule with our account advisor AFTER the statement comes out, for this UNKNOWN amount charged by the branch.

Switch to other banks. The hours saved will makes up for the cheaper banking fees. If you stay, be ready to defend your account from the incompetent shenanigans and educated guesses that these tellers have in store.",2.3,1734474818

Plus, i was previously leveled out of my online banking account so for them to ask me what my estimated balance is and i not know.. like why are we surprised, of course i cant tell you i haven’t looked at my account in 4 flipping days. anyways due to this racist interaction i have closed my scotiabank account. there are too many banks in canada to work with someone who you don’t like.",2.3,1718650067

"Called to request a credit increase. Was told that they would need to do a credit check in order to do that. They asked for my permission and was told that it would take seven to ten days. I could get a mortgage in that time , however I consented. After two weeks I hadn’t heard anything I called to find out the progress. I was told that I couldn’t request an increase before six months. At the time of my initial phone call it was a little over two weeks until the six months was up, but they accepted my request and asked if they  could do a credit check which I consented to. No one mentioned that I could not increase the the amount before six months. I asked to speak to a manager and was told they were not available. It is quite obvious that they are hiring minimum wage employees with poor English skills and not training them adequately. The customer service is poor at best.

Received a reply very quickly regarding my review. Acknowledged that the situation was not handled appropriately, and provided a new phone number to call so that a resolution could be expedited. Phoned the next morning and surprise! I get the general customer service centre and some poor representative who knows nothing about my issue, and doesn’t know who does. After being on hold for several minutes was told someone would call me by days end.
After receiving a reply to my review I would have expected that a manager would contact me, not send me a phone number to call where I get the run around again. As I said before, customer service is terrible. The representative that I spoke to did all that he could, but there is obviously a large problem with management.
So the saga continues. After yesterday’s phone call, I was assured I would receive a phone call by days end. That did not happen. It is very apparent that this company has no real interest in resolving any problems. They send a response to a review and hope that you do not actually act on the offer to contact them. When you do respond, they leave it to the customer service rep to deal with the unhappy customers. Quite a unique management style. If you deal with this company, do not expect any actual customer service if you have an issue.",2.5,1734528730
"They deliberately made us do two Appraisals on our house. They took 50% each time, one of the individuals doing the appraisal showed us the email from home trust proving this.

They have antiquated practices that involved having to walk a cheque into their office whenever they can, and be late on a payment and they punish you in a biblical fashion.
Honestly steer clear of these guys if you need a loan at all cost.

"As both a long-time customer of this branch, over 10 years, I want to provide some balanced feedback on the service at this branch. I understand many people's frustration about slow service and staff interactions, but there's more to the story behind the scenes.

One major issue is the reduction of hours for employees. Most staff members are part-time, working only 20 hours a week, even though many are available and willing to work full-time or take on more shifts. This decision, driven by management, has led to understaffing, overworked employees, and higher turnover rates. The frequent rotations of staff mean many are new or still adjusting, making it hard for the team to provide the level of service customers expect. - that's feedback from the staff

Additionally, the pressure on employees to prioritize sales over solving customers' issues is a problem. The staff are genuinely kind and hardworking, but they're often left without the support they need. Managers are frequently unavailable for necessary overrides, causing delays, and employees are left to handle the fallout, which can understandably frustrate both sides.

While the service quality has definitely declined, I believe it's due to poor management choices rather than the fault of the individuals working at the branch. They are doing their best with the limited resources and support they have. As a customer, I also hate the long waits and issues like check holds, but I feel it's important to recognize the broader challenges the staff are facing.

I hope all these kids find something better than what this place is.",2.1,1730324742
"This branch has the longest, most miserable and unbearable wait times. Just to do a simple business deposit will take you an average of 45 minutes and I’ve been here several times and things are likely not to improve. Why can’t they add more staff to assist customers?

Not only was I present to see that the planner included the draft along with all of the other necessary documentation, but it was sent registered and is documented that it was received on a Tuesday and after several days of following up and inquiring what the status is this department finally admitted on Friday that they did not have the draft. And at that time tried to place blame on my financial planner here in Niagara. This sort of conduct was not only unprofessional, but I was shocked at the complete and utter lack of accountability. Fast-forward a week later, they have received a letter of indemnity so that the other financial institution can process a new draft And they have yet to sign and process that one single document. So now I have $270,000 floating around doing absolutely nothing for weeks on end and this facility this department with these people not only have shown no accountability, but have displayed gross negligence, a complete disregard for myself and my family as a client at this bank, zero sense of urgency to resolve the matter that they themselves have created.

This language barrier not only impeded her understanding of the information and services being offered but also added to her discomfort in an already challenging situation. In a diverse country like Canada, it is essential for institutions, including banks, to provide multilingual support to accommodate all customers effectively. It would have been greatly beneficial if the branch had provided a translator or made arrangements to offer assistance in her native language.

I will have to pay CRA interest and penalties 100% because of Smartfolio's delayed and problematic tax reporting to the CRA. I suffered for a few years and then said forget, and left.

The government no longer issues sin cards. It's now paper. Must have dealt with 20 people all completely ignorant to facts. The phone representative then called to have my behavior checked by the branch because and I quote I was a little rude ..... because they were proved factually wrong. Funny enough they hung up the phone after being extremely rude and reacting on my personal information because they were embarrassed. Completely unprofessional,  nit to mention no knowledge of our government is extremely concerning when ur dealing with our money.

I've been an RBC client for nearly 2 decades, and I've never regretted my decision until I decided to work with this branch.

"I was instructed to go to the branch to activate my account as a requirement for finalizing my Scotiabank mortgage. Due to their business hours, I had to leave work early two days in a row, and after two attempts it was still not something they were able or willing(?) to help me with.

I explained when I got to the branch what I needed help with. I was not listened to. I got instead:
- “You’re here to apply for a mortgage?”
- Attempts to upsell me to credit cards and more expensive banking packages
- Directions contrary to the mortgage rep‘s instructions and no sense of urgency about getting the requirements of the mortgage satisfied
- General confusion about how to activate an account - it felt like they’d never done it before
- The sense that I was a sales opportunity, as opposed to someone who they were there to assist

Needless to say, I will not be using Scotiabank for any future banking outside of my mortgage, and will be changing my home branch.

Edit: 3 months later and I am now receiving calls from Scotiabank's call centres trying to push more unnecessary financial products on me.

Edit: 5 months later and I just learned that despite taking the money from my mortgage account, Scotiabank has not paid my first two instalments of my property taxes and I have been hit with late-payment penalty fees. The call centre says the bank is ""behind"" on property taxes currently and my only way to resolve this is to go into a branch. Scotiabank - your incompetence should not come at my expense.

"Called to request a credit increase. Was told that they would need to do a credit check in order to do that. They asked for my permission and was told that it would take seven to ten days. I could get a mortgage in that time , however I consented. After two weeks I hadn’t heard anything I called to find out the progress. I was told that I couldn’t request an increase before six months. At the time of my initial phone call it was a little over two weeks until the six months was up, but they accepted my request and asked if they  could do a credit check which I consented to. No one mentioned that I could not increase the the amount before six months. I asked to speak to a manager and was told they were not available. It is quite obvious that they are hiring minimum wage employees with poor English skills and not training them adequately. The customer service is poor at best.

Received a reply very quickly regarding my review. Acknowledged that the situation was not handled appropriately, and provided a new phone number to call so that a resolution could be expedited. Phoned the next morning and surprise! I get the general customer service centre and some poor representative who knows nothing about my issue, and doesn’t know who does. After being on hold for several minutes was told someone would call me by days end.
After receiving a reply to my review I would have expected that a manager would contact me, not send me a phone number to call where I get the run around again. As I said before, customer service is terrible. The representative that I spoke to did all that he could, but there is obviously a large problem with management.
So the saga continues. After yesterday’s phone call, I was assured I would receive a phone call by days end. That did not happen. It is very apparent that this company has no real interest in resolving any problems. They send a response to a review and hope that you do not actually act on the offer to contact them. When you do respond, they leave it to the customer service rep to deal with the unhappy customers. Quite a unique management style.

We figured it would be easy as we already had our mortgage with them We asked for a home equity loan and they insisted a visa card was better but it really is worse.

They have antiquated practices that involved having to walk a cheque into their office whenever they can, and be late on a payment and they punish you in a biblical fashion.
Honestly steer clear of these guys if you need a loan at all cost.

- block my card during vacation in India when I told them before i left that I was gone for a very long time; they wanted me to fly back to canada to verify who I am which ended my vacation because RBC held my money.
- blocked my card twice in one week, second time was while I was in Waterloo and they refused to unblock it and demanded that I go to a bank.  it's the long weekend and BANKS are closed.  Ran out of gas coming home because I have no money because RBC is holding it ransom and now I am praying my car is still there and not towed.
- I had 900 stolen from my account via online transactions, I call in to report it and I am told after their investigation that its my fault even thou I did not make the transaction and they will not provide me any useful information for me to be able to deal with this.

"Sakina is the absolute best - not only was she able to beat CIBC, RBC and TD’s rates but she also made sure the entire mortgage application was smooth. My mortgage was approved 4-5 days before closing (as opposed to some other banks/brokers that get you the approval the day of closing)

She took care of everything from RRSP withdrawal to making sure all statements were accounted for.

Compared to the experience my friends have had with mortgage brokers and other banks, my experience was FAR superior and top class.",3.2,1688214186

"My boyfriend and I just recently joined BMO and had the pleasure of having Lois Xue a personal banker assist us in setting up our accounts.

She made everything very easy to understand and took the time to help us pick a bank account that works best for us. Originally, it was only suppose to be my boyfriend opening an account. However, Lois was so easy to speak to I ended up opening an account for myself too. She made us aware of a ""New To Canada"" offer the bank had available and explained everything we needed to know about it.

The lobby manager was also a complete gentleman!",3.2,1614886647

So why do you send me an email that I did PRE-APPROVE for 3,000 Cashback MasterCard?!! So dumb. Heads up everyone that's with BMO, totally can't trust/believe the beautiful offers you get from BMO!!

"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service provided at your branch, During a recent visit. my mother who was feeling unwell, faced significant challenges due to the absence of Arabic speaking staff, Despite her best efforts to open a BMO banking account. she encountered considerable difficulties because there was no attempt made by the staff to arrange for Arabic-speaking assistance.

This language barrier not only impeded her understanding of the information and services being offered but also added to her discomfort in an already challenging situation. In a diverse country like Canada, it is essential for institutions, including banks, to provide multilingual support to accommodate all customers effectively. It would have been greatly beneficial if the branch had provided a translator or made arrangements to offer assistance in her native language.

I hope that BMO will consider improving language services to better assist clients who do not speak English or French. Providing adequate language support is not just a matter of convenience but an important aspect of delivering inclusive and effective customer service.",2.7,1726241748

My branch in downtown London is the kept My loyalty and always recommend it to anyone saying it proudly their the best for multiple reasons. They are always number one. Even their number says it all 001 first class as I always told myself. Their direct deposit is always at midnight and sometimes earlier. When ever money comes in I seem to be always the only one gets their pay first. Telling my friends, family, coworkers, basically everyone I come across. And whenever looking at pictures of Canada's biggest and best city. The tallest big white building is my bank with the bold blue letters BMO at the top of the tallest building in the city that stands closest to the CN Tower. Well they let me down today. They let me stand their waiting as the room starts to fill with people and none of them asking me if I need assistance. They all watched me stand their and they all continue to walk away. None of them asking to wait or come back. They just watched me walk away. No one ever let me walk away with out putting up a fight before. I guess BMO is my first.",2.7,1721731588

I requested a credit card over 32 days ago, and still have not received my card. To make matters worse, the card that is now in progress to be sent to my house is not the card I requested. When the calling the call centre, their response is, they cannot help as this matter needs to be dealt by the branch. BMO has poor integration between branch and corporate. The customer service is terrible and I will be terminating any financial relationship the next chance I get.",2.7,1711816033

The staff at NBC Bank genuinely care about my financial well-being and take the time to understand my needs. They're knowledgeable, responsive, and always willing to go the extra mile.

What impresses me most, however, is the bank's commitment to building lasting relationships with its clients. They truly know me by name and tailor their services to fit my unique needs.

it is the second time i'm visiting this branch. My need was to ask replacement of credit card. People who sit behind tables even don't have any idea how to do the process. Finally i have decided to call support to help me.  Ignorance and unprofessional attitude. I feel pity on people who manage this branch. I've noticed such a bad review earlier too. How come the senior management is accepting such bad reviews ???  Or they dont really care about customers?,2.6,1737662528

Make appointment with Chole Lui and she cannot give me a straight answer but apparently I cannot open my account till a week later!

My best friends in London, UK are working with credit unions because it is more in line with the spirit of cooperation and solidarity. I wanted to give it a try here too. From the first moment on, the incredibly meaningless paperwork turned ridiculous and resulted in my credit card application (for a very silly symbolic amount, actualy) being declined. I was planning to bank with Meridan both in my personal capacity and as a future law business holder and got totally disappointed today. As high as the other, conventional banking fees are in Canada, it is not worth resorting to credit unions, especially Meridian. Sorry.",3,1697733174

They are extremely unhelpful and unwilling to solve even the simplest issues, even when there are clear and easy fixes available. I’ve been bounced around from one representative to another. The branch manager did not even bother to come out of their room and talk to me regarding the issue.This is definitely not the first time I’ve encountered such terrible service with them, and I’ve had enough.

After handling the business, I told him that I was very dissatisfied with today's experience, and did not say sorry to me during the whole process. He just looked at me like this. I felt that I suffered discrimination in RBC today for the first time in history, why do you treat your customers differently? All the people who came in after me were very good.

For me if I really can not get it, it’s fine but the way she told it it to me was not fine .  Even the teller who I spoke first was not able to talk.

I haven't had the communication issues that others have mentioned; my emails have always been answered within a couple business days. The bank also has a system to book a call with a customer service agent and they were ready on time.

I have the best rate in the industry with them right now at 4.20% for a 1 year GIC. My other bank offered just 3%. So far so good, no complaints.

The result is that the money was not a fraud, but a telephone verification was sent. I have never received any SMS verification.

So I brought Service Canada's Receipt with me Containing the original Copy that this bank has Kept, and now informs me that they'll call me in 3 or 4 business days, mind you I have the Same Birth certificates today as I used before, and I have the Same Ontario Health Card that I provide the Same as Then when I opened my Original Account on Eglinton Ave.

Mind while I Used these Same ID's today that The BMO in Brantford Accepted from me in September 2023.

So my question now is why aren't these Vary Same ID's accepted at this Branch.

And why has this Process become so difficult that it takes 3 visits in person to the Bank..Then to be... told to wait for their Response that would take 3-5 business working days for them to reply to me by Phone.

While in addition..I've also offered additional ID's and a Letter from the (Department of Corrections from To The Correctional Services of Canada, Federal Parolee for 18 years, whose gonna come into a Bank in the first place admitting to be an Ex-con in the first Place.

Personally....and truly...no matter how badly I truly need this Bank Account...that after this and ""once I do recieve my Provincial ID from Service Canada within their 4-6 Week waiting Period.

There's absolutely""No Way that I Will Stay with BMO after this experience especially where this Serverally has Effect my Grant and My Loan that has been Offered to me as a $26.000 loan, which OSAP Student Funding awaits my Banking Details in order to Complete this Enrollment.

Which means that This could Possibly be Setting my College Courses by Another Year when it's Scheduled to completion for June 20th 2025.

And is Scheduled to begin on June 24th 2025, to which Everything Now hinges on My Bank Re-Opening my Account.

"Upon careful observation, it is evident that this BMO branch in question is facing significant challenges when it comes to their understanding of the company's products, promotions, and policies. If this continues to go unchecked, it is highly likely that the quality of service provided to customers like me will continue to suffer. My recent experience of opening a new account was nothing short of frustrating, and I strongly believe that the service provided was subpar. If the branch fails to improve its services, it will undoubtedly face difficulties in retaining customers, thereby losing business to other branches that provide better service.",3.2,1707320229

I pointed out that the posted hours indicate you're open until 6 pm, but he rudely responded, ""I said it's appointment only."" Since when do you have to make an appointment to ask a teller a question? This all happened while they were chatting with each other, and there were no other customers in the branch besides me.

So now your bank machines are covered in receipts envelopes and other paper products because no one has anywhere to throw their junk.

They tried 4 times for the application and at the end they told me that I would NEVER get approved for any type of credit card, not even for the minimum amount and recommended me to apply after six months. However, when applied by myself, just an hour after they said I would never get approved,  from the app, I've got approved. It's either I do really know how to apply or they actually don't know what they are doing or how to help customers or most likely both!.

I was literally considering close all my accounts with TD and go to another bank because of the way I was treated!

However, no such update was ever provided. I continued to follow up with him over email, and telephone, and with his Associate Carl Domingo, but neither of them replied to my emails or picked up my phone calls. It's been almost a month and I have yet to receive a response from them. Even if my application were to be rejected, they had the responsibility of replying to me in a timely manner as per their own specified date. I found them ceasing all communication with me completely unprofessional. Based on my experience, I will not recommend William Lee and Carl Domingo's services to anyone.

"I emailed the following to customer service.

Dear Customer Service,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a recent experience I had at your branch located at 522 University Avenue on January 27, 2025 approximately at 2:16 PM.

I visited the branch to request a reversal of a bank charge that I incurred while still a student. Initially, I asked the teller to reverse a payment made in January; however, I later realized that I was also charged in December. The teller informed me that he could only process the request for January and that I would need to visit my home branch to address the December charge.

While I understand the policies that may prevent him from assisting further, I found his demeanor to be passive-aggressive and unhelpful. My request to have both charges reversed was not met with understanding, and I expressed that having to travel to my home branch was an inconvenience. Unfortunately, the teller seemed uninterested in helping me find a solution.

When I mentioned that I would consider filing a complaint, his response was dismissive, and when I asked for his name or employee number, he stated that he was not obligated to provide that information. To add to my frustration, the branch manager present during our interaction echoed the teller's stance, leading me to feel that there was no viable resolution to my situation at the branch level.

I firmly believe in the importance of customer service, especially in financial institutions where trust and transparency are paramount. I hope that my feedback will be taken seriously and that steps will be taken to ensure that future customers do not encounter a similar experience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

"Terrible Service and Incompetence at Scotiabank
I’ve had two frustrating experiences with Scotiabank that make it the worst bank I’ve ever dealt with.
1. I needed a bank statement showing the average balance over the last six months. I visited this branch three times, spoke to two different people, and was told they couldn’t provide it. Eventually, at another branch, they showed me multiple templates for this document, and I easily chose one. How could one branch be so unhelpful while another handled it effortlessly?
2. I updated my status at the branch, and they assured me it was entered into the system. Days later, nothing had changed online. I returned, and they insisted it was already on the system and that it “just takes time to show up.” Fast forward two months—I called customer service, only to hear that nothing had been updated at all!
This level of disorganization and misinformation is unacceptable.",2.3,1734401048

I rarely write a review but this branch is one of the worst I have ever been to. The staff is so rude and very unfriendly. I came here a couple of times because of an ongoing problem with a cheque, since December of last year and they have done nothing to help me.

Mary didn’t wanted me to have her business card and most of the time she didn’t know how to solve the issue. She kept telling me the same thing over and over again. She basically told me that I will not get my money back.

When wanting to reach the manager she was always not there and couldn’t tell me on a date she was available.

If you have a Tangerine account they do not let you exchange for USD unless you have CAD cash. I'm just grateful I had cash cause apparently the ATM wasn't working. Otherwise teller was very helpful with the exchange.,2.2,1710782276

If there is 7 stars I will give for Mr James Fleming. Is the best customer service and the best with the business account. You feel like he gives you the best experience. He changed my mind from moving to another bank through his service.,3.5,1736443399
"Had an easy time opening an account. They have good deals for newcomers. Park Junhong and Boer were the officers who helped me with the applications and were very knowledgeable, friendly and well mannered.",3.5,1689388364
"As someone new to Canada on the IEC visa, it was important for me to set up a new bank account as easily as possible. Jaspreet was incredible in helping me with this. He provided me with a lot of advice about the banking system (as well as general Toronto tips)! Extremely helpful and professional. 10/10 service.",3.5,1730045645

Many thanks to Tahmid! I had an outstanding experience with him. He paid effort to resolve a long-standing issue of mine by proactively offering solution and assistance. His professionalism and dedication is greatly appreciated,3.5,1717385255
"I have only had 2 interactions with this branch, but on both occasions, I have found staff to be poorly trained, rude, unprofessional and lacking even basic customer service skills, so avoid using them at all costs. Staff seem more concerned with selling you products to hit targets rather than actually helping you resolve issues. Professional standards are also lacking and staff are far too casual for a financial institution: wearing t-shirts to work, not wearing name tags, not even giving their name when greeting you or asking yours, unable to communicate with you clearly, not asking questions to understand your situation, leaving you waiting 10-15 minutes without explanation, discussing your issues with colleagues directly in-front of different clients, taking your documents/information away without asking, calling you unsolicited to sell you products, and becoming defensive and rude if you ask to speak to management or raise a concern about the level of service. Even after speaking to the manager on more than one occassion, nothing has changed, and standards are actually getting worse. Not the kind of place you want to invest your hard earned money and investments into. Avoid.",3.4,1724957296
"Visited the bank on Aug 31 at 12 PM. When I arrived, there were two bankers present and one of them told me that he would bring someone else to assist me with. I waited 20 minutes and no one came. So I asked another banker when that assistance is coming and he told that those two bankers are the only ones working today. I asked then what the other guy was referring to as ""assistance"" and he just waved his head, no explanation or no apologies. I asked him how long he needs with his current customer and he said another 15-20 minutes.

Both bankers could have advised us that they are busy with their current customers and told us to come back. They instead gave us a false impression that we will get help if we wait just a little bit, and wasted our 20 minutes and potentially another 15-20 minutes on top of that if I didn't ask.

1. Don't lie that help is coming if there is no help coming
2. Ger some common sense and tell your customers that you need 25-30 minutes before you can see them if you see 4 people waiting in line, so that they can make a decision to leave or stay rather than waiting for you blindly.",3.4,1725121987
"I have been maintaining my account with BMO for many years and this is by far the worst branch I have come across. Total unprofessionalism is the motto of this branch. My personal experiences are:
1). Wanted to open an account for a minor, went to this brand at 0300 pm on Saturday (the branch closes at 0400 pm). There were two customer being served before us and we were patiently waiting for our turn. Suddenly Mr. Asst. Manager rushed towards us and asked us the ""reason"" of us being in his branch. Upon hearing the purpose of our visit, he went to one of the two associates handling the customers before us and the rudely said HE HAS AN APPOINTMENT at 04:00 pm (mind it, the time was 03:00 pm and the branch closes at 04:00 pm) so he can not serve us. Mr. Asst. Manager, without checking with the other teller, simply hushed us away mentioning that the Account can only be opened with an preschedule appointment. My minor was shocked and wondering whether this is the new Canada we are living in and whether now BMO considers opening an account (for a minor - first account of the life) a favour to Canadians?

The same time I went to another branch, reached there at 0330 pm and all the formalities were completed within 15 min. The staff was so cooperative that she assisted my minor to set up her Phone App as well.

2). I wanted to transfer the funds to US which is very regular practice for me. The BMO always charged the transfer fee from my Canadian account. The staff told it is against the policy and the bank charges would only be deducted from the US Account. I gave them the receipt of my previous transfer (5 days ago) from a different branch where BMO indeed charged the bank charges from the Canadian Account and asked whether BMO has two separate policies among different branches? . The staff went to the same Mr. Asst. Manager who came out and told ""HE HAS HEARD THIS STORY BEFORE ALSO"" (these are his exact words without any exaggeration) when people come and TRY to pay bank charges in CDN funds. Seriously. If this the standard of BMO these days, I will better take my business somewhere else.",3.4,1720284145
"I had an amazing experience at this branch. Artem helped with the account opening, walking through the financials, solving my queries. He ensures that he stays connected with his clients and they get the best service.
Thanks Artem for all the assistance.
Also, other staff members were really warm and nice at the Grand Opening Day of this branch. Overall great staff members, good service and nice branch.",3.4,1692995838
Had a great experience at this branch. Artem assisted me with opening a new account and walked me through some credit card options. He was knowledgeable and made things easy to understand. Really appreciated the efficient service. Would recommend!,3.4,1692826430
Waited patiently for 10 mins in line as the other teller had a sign up saying his station was closed. A different couple walked up past him and he removed his plaque immediately to assist them. Only when the lady saw this did she  bother to tell me that i was lining up on the wrong side. I was the only one in line.,3.2,1735586386
"Amazing Staff. Very understanding of people’s needs, and attentive to detail. Thank you 😊!!!",3.2,1733490240
"Kevin was super kind and helpful, went the extra mile to help with my request. Thanks again",3.2,1723609920
The ATMs are ALWAYS BROKEN. It’s INFURIATING. It’s not a big enough branch for there to be NO ATM ACCESS ALL THE TIME. It’s enough for me to switch banks. Get it sorted.,3.2,1721738213
"Came to get my banking information to receive an international wire. The person that helped looked confused, and ended up giving me the information for the wrong account (after indicating I did not want the wire to arrive to that account). This has been an expensive ordeal for me, my wire was sent to the account that was not supposed to go to. Seriously, useless. I needed an official form that’s why I came to the branch. Should have double checked myself, never trusting coming to the branch again. Terrible service.",3.2,1690307869

"Very long line ups and customer service advisors do little to nothing to acknowledge waiting customers. Expect the line up to stay stagnant for up to 30 min during busy periods.I had to visit because I had no choice. FYI, this location closes at 7pm, mon to fri.",1,1722550102
